# Contributing to OWASP Dependency-Track

Thank you for participating in making Dependency-Track better! We appreciate and are thankful for contributions in
all shapes and sizes.

## Asking Questions

Our documentation has a community-maintained section for [frequently asked questions](https://docs.dependencytrack.org/FAQ/).
Take the time to check whether your question has already been answered in the FAQ.

In general, the best place to ask questions or get in touch with users and other contributors is the 
[`#proj-dependencytrack`](https://dependencytrack.org/slack) channel of the OWASP Slack space. 
Alternatively, [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/discussions) may be used.

A well worded question will help serve as a resource to others searching for help. Avoid contacting individual
contributors directly and ask questions in public instead.

## Requesting Features
