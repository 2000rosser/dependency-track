**Upgrade Notes:**

* The API server now requires Java 21 or newer. Users deploying Dependency-Track via containers
don't have to do anything, since those have been shipped with Java 21 since version 4.10.0.
Users deploying Dependency-Track as JAR will need to upgrade their Java installation accordingly.
* The `/api/swagger.json` endpoint no longer exists. The REST API documentation is now available
at `/api/openapi.json` and `/api/openapi.yaml` respectively. The documentation format follows
the OpenAPI v3 specification, the Swagger v2 format is no longer provided.
* The `/api/v1/tag/{policyUuid}` REST API endpoint has been deprecated in favor of
`/api/v1/tag/policy/{uuid}`. Users relying on the outdated endpoint for their custom integrations
are encouraged to migrate to the new endpoint.
* The legacy BOM processing logic was removed. The *BOM Processing V2* option introduced in v4.11 is now the default
and the only available option. To gauge the impact of this change, consider enabling the experimental option in
an existing v4.11 deployment first.
