title: v4.11.0
type: major
---

**Highlights:**

* **Optimized BOM Ingestion**. The logic how uploaded BOMs are processed and ingested into Dependency-Track has been
overhauled to be more reliable and efficient. Further, BOM processing is now an atomic operation, such that errors
occurring midway do not cause a partial state to be left behind. De-duplication of components and services is more
predictable, and log messages emitted during processing contain additional context, making them easier to correlate.
Because the new implementation can have a big impact on how Dependency-Track behaves regarding BOM uploads,
it is disabled by default for this release. It may be enabled by setting the environment variable `BOM_PROCESSING_TASK_V2_ENABLED`
to `true`. Users are highly encouraged to do so.
* **BOM Validation**. Historically, Dependency-Track did not validate uploaded BOMs and VEXs against the CycloneDX
schema. While this allowed BOMs to be processed that did not strictly adhere to the schema, it could lead to confusion
when uploaded files were accepted, but then failed to be ingested during asynchronous processing. Starting with this
release, uploaded files will be rejected if they fail schema validation. Note that this may reveal issues in BOM
generators that currently produce invalid CycloneDX documents. Validation may be turned off by setting the
environment variable `BOM_VALIDATION_ENABLED` to `false`.

**Upgrade Notes:**

* To enable the optimized BOM ingestion, set the environment variable `BOM_PROCESSING_TASK_V2_ENABLED` to `true`
* Validation of uploaded BOMs and VEXs is enabled per default, but can be disabled by setting the environment
variable `BOM_VALIDATION_ENABLED` to `false`
* The `CWE` table is dropped automatically upon upgrade
* The default logging configuration ([logback.xml]) was updated to include the [Mapped Diagnostic Context] (MDC)
  * Users who [customized their logging configuration] are recommended to follow this change
* Severities of vulnerabilities that previously had `NULL` severities in the database will be computed
and updated automatically upon upgrade, based on CVSSv2, CVSSv3, and OWASP Risk Rating scores
  * Database updates are batched, the entire procedure should complete 30s to 1min
* The following configuration properties were renamed:
  * `ossindex.retry.backoff.max.duration` → `ossindex.retry.backoff.max.duration.ms`
  * `snyk.retry.exponential.backoff.multiplier` → `snyk.retry.backoff.multiplier`
  * `snyk.retry.exponential.backoff.initial.duration.seconds` → `snyk.retry.backoff.initial.duration.ms`
  * `snyk.retry.exponential.backoff.max.duration.seconds` → `snyk.retry.backoff.max.duration.ms`
* Configuration properties for retry durations are now specified in milliseconds instead of seconds
* The following default values for configuration properties have changed:
  * `ossindex.retry.backoff.max.duration.ms`: 600000ms (10min) → 60000ms (1min)
* The `name` tag of the `resilience4j_retry_calls_total` for OSS Index has changed from `ossIndexRetryer` to `ossindex-api`
